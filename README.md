# Effect of changes in CO2 concentrations on the seasonal climate in different cities using an idealized radiative-convective climate model

This repository contains all the code I used to finish my final research project for my Atmospheric Physics course on Fall 2022 at UAlbany, SUNY. The repository contains the following

* Jupyter Notebooks containing my Python codes to perform the CO2 and monthly temperature experiments on the six cities: Moscow, Ryadh, Kinshasa, Manila, NYC, and Sao Paulo
* netCDF containing the monthly gridded surface temperatures for 1991-2020 from NCEP-NCAR Reanalysis
* My final research paper

The file size of the netCDF containing the monthly gridded solar insolation for 2001-2020 from CERES is too big and can't be uploaded here. It can be accessed through the following link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ouUFp4Ax1tT5TqPU8tU4vscjUrxiAiti/view?usp=sharing.
